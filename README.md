Potted Palace Plant Nursery DB
Co-Author: Melissa Babcock
This is a project completed for Intro to Databases at Oregon State University
We transformed an idea into a database. Using the database, we developed a web-based UI, providing Create-Read-Update-Delete (CRUD) functionalities. 
The database is prepopulated with sample data.

All the source code, including files containing CSS, HTML, JS and the code for server-side platform chosen, is included.
